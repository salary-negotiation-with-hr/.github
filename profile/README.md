### Steps to Prepare for Salary Negotiation

1. **Research Industry Standards**  
   Understand the market rate for your role, experience level, and location. Use platforms like LinkedIn Salary Insights, Glassdoor, or Payscale to gather data.

2. **Evaluate Your Value**  
   Highlight your skills, certifications, and achievements that justify your salary expectations. Be ready to explain how your contributions will benefit the organization.

3. **Define Your Salary Range**  
   Have a clear range with a minimum acceptable figure. This provides flexibility while ensuring your lower limit aligns with your financial needs.

4. **Practice Your Pitch**  
   Prepare and rehearse responses to common negotiation questions. Practice maintaining a calm, professional tone.

### How to Negotiate Salary with HR: Key Strategies

#### 1. **Start with Gratitude**  
   Express appreciation for the offer and the opportunity before initiating any negotiation. For example:  
   “Thank you for the offer. I’m excited about the role and contributing to the team. I’d like to discuss the compensation package.”

#### 2. **Present Your Research**  
   Use data to back your request. Example:  
   “Based on my research, the market rate for similar roles with my experience is in the range of ₹70,000 to ₹80,000. Considering my background, I believe a salary closer to the higher end is fair.”

#### 3. **Be Ready to Discuss CTC Structure**  
   Understand how components like Basic Pay, HRA, and performance bonuses impact your take-home salary. Clarify any terms that are unclear.

#### 4. **Ask Smart Questions**  
   - What performance metrics influence salary revisions?  
   - Are there signing bonuses or relocation allowances?  
   - Can any non-monetary benefits be added to the package?

#### 5. **Politely Handle Counteroffers**  
   If HR presents a counteroffer, remain composed and evaluate if it aligns with your expectations. Consider benefits beyond salary, such as health insurance, leave policies, and flexible work options.
